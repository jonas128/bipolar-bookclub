# Code Review

Code review written by [Johanna Pihl](https://github.com/Emma-Jonna).

1. `index.html:10-15` - Could have been clearer if you used the tags header, main footer to divide upp the code in distinct parts.
2. `script.js:79-87` - Remember that there are multiple ways to write a function, for example an arrow function.
3. `script.js:34-66` - Maybe you could have a few more comments that briefly explains what the function does.
4. `styles.css:05-06` - Remember that woff2 is supposed to appear before woff just like you hade written in the code that is commented out.
5. `images:` - Would have been a bit more clearer if the pictures in the folder had more descriptive names, for example the book title so it's easier to see what the pictures are.
